        <h2>Marbury v. Madison- Background</h2>
        <p>In the final days of John Adams' presidency (1801), he appointed severeal Federalist judges that were unable to receive their proper commissions after Adams left office. 
            One of those judges was William Marbury; upon Thomas Jefferson being sworn into office, Jefferson refused to give Marbury his commission. Chief Justice John Marshall, a Federalist and Adams appointee, presided over the case. The Court faced the dilemma of balancing the demands of an individual's right to their commission against the potential encroachment on the authority of the executive branch under President Jefferson.
        </p>

        <h2>Marbury v. Madison- Ruling</h2>
        <p> William Marbury, one of Adams' appointees, had been nominated as a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia but did not receive his official commission before the end of Adams' term. When Jefferson took office, his Secretary of State, James Madison, refused to deliver Marbury's commission.Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court, seeking a writ of mandamus, which would compel Madison to deliver his commission. Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the Court, ruled that while Marbury was entitled to his commission, the Court did not have the authority under the Judiciary Act of 1789 to issue a writ of mandamus in this case.

        <h2>Marbury v. Madison- Significance</h2>
        <p>Marbury v. Madison set the precedent for judicial review, affirming the Supreme Court's authority to review the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress. It strengthened the balance of power among the branches of government by establishing the judiciary's role as a check on legislative and executive actions that exceed constitutional bounds. The decision solidified the Court's status as the final arbiter of the Constitution's meaning. Chief Justice Marshall asserted that it was the duty of the judiciary to interpret the Constitution and that any law conflicting with the Constitution is invalid. This landmark ruling solidified the Court's authority in interpreting the Constitution and set the precedent for the concept of judicial review, which remains a fundamental principle of American constitutional law.

        <h2>Marbury v. Madison- Interesting Facts</h2>
        <li>While the decision in Marbury v. Madison was significant in establishing the Court's power of judicial review, it took some time for its full impact to be realized. The Supreme Court didn't exercise this power extensively until later cases in the 20th century.</li>
        <li>Despite the case being about a relatively minor political appointment, its legacy has been far-reaching. The principle of judicial review laid out in Marbury v. Madison remains a cornerstone of American constitutional law and a critical element in checks and balances within the government.</li>
        <li>Chief Justice John Marshall, who presided over the case, did not sign the Court's opinion until after the case was decided. This ensured that his decision remained independent of the outcome, emphasizing the Court's authority over the issue.</li>
        <li>During the trial, Chief Justice Marshall relied on the Judiciary Act of 1789 to invalidate a portion of it. Interestingly, this was the same law Congress passed to establish the federal court system, yet Marshall was willing to declare a part of it unconstitutional.</li>
        <li>William Marbury wasn't just an individual seeking his commission. He was also a prominent figure in the Federalist Party and was appointed as a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia. This dual role added political weight to the case.</li>
        <li>Chief Justice John Marshall, who authored the Court's opinion in Marbury v. Madison, had a prior career as a diplomat. His experience likely influenced his legal reasoning and the tactful handling of a case that held significant political implications.</li>
        <li>Despite the Court's ruling in his favor regarding the commission, William Marbury never served as a justice of the peace, as the delivery of his commission was not enforced.</li>
